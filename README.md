# Leap_Motion_Element_Game

An in-browser game that utilizes a Leap Motion hand tracking device as a controller for an element-based game.

In the game, player makes different gestures over the leap motion device that correspond to different elements. The player
must respond to the element of the on-screen enemy and by gesturing the element that the enemy is weak to.

The project uses a KNN classification algorithm in order to tell what gesture the player is making.

This project is made primarily in Javascript.

Running this project requires a Leap Motion device.
